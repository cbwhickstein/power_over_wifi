# Power over WIFI

## Introduction
Hey I created this project to power up my PC from remote locations.
Because my PC uses a intel Gen 13 core, I want to shut it completley off.
The much more easy alternative for you would be the Power over LAN function that most
Mainboards support. But I don't want to run my PC even on low power 24/7.

## Notes
To run this on your ESP, please read the README in src, it explains how you can
set the SSID and Password to your own.
